MIMIC models trained and tested on the MIMIC test set - using the architecture derived from Seyyed-Kalantari et al.

Validation step was kept in to modify code the least amount possible, used the validation split from the Seyyed-Kalantari paper, only used to generate thresholds and, in turn, the bipred csv.

The preds csv, and the true csv for all images in the test set are stored in the MIMIC results folder.
