CheXpert models tested on the entire MIMIC dataset - using the architecture derived from Seyyed-Kalantari et al.

Validation step was kept in to modify code the least amount possible, used the validation split from the Seyyed-Kalantari paper, only used to generate thresholds and, in turn, the bipred csv.

The preds csv, and the true csv for all images are stored in the CheXpert results folder.
